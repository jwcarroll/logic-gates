# Custom Group Ports fixtures

Fixtures in this folder are used by the `001-custom-group-ports` feature tests to validate:

- Import/export schema version gating (legacy rejection + v1.2 acceptance)
- Presence of explicit group interfaces (`group.data.interface`)
- Presence of `junction` nodes used as interface anchors
