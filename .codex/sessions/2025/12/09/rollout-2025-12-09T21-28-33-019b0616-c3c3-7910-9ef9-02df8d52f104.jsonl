Strict TS.\n- Directories:\n  - `src/core/`: types, IDs, validation, graph ops, simulation, import/export (pure, no React).\n  - `src/app/`: Zustand store, commands, selectors, persistence, RF adapter.\n  - `src/ui/`: React components, React Flow node/edge renderers.\n  - `src/design/`: tokens, themes, icons, canvas styles, primitives.\n  - `src/tests/`: unit/integration; `e2e/`: Playwright specs/fixtures.\n\n## Specification Artifacts (to author before coding)\n- Core API spec: commands, queries, invariants, error semantics.\n- Simulation spec: convergence rules, defaults for missing inputs, handling cycles.\n- Import/export spec: schemas, validation errors, migrations (v1.0 → v1.1 metadata).\n- UI interaction spec: gestures, selection precedence, keyboard shortcuts, touch behaviors, wire flows.\n- Design system spec: tokens, components (button, toolbar, panel, context menu, toast, dropdown), canvas theming, port/wire states.\n- Testing spec: coverage goals, fixtures, golden files, performance budgets.\n\n## Architecture & Separation\n- Core (pure):\n  - Data types and ID generation.\n  - Graph operations: add/remove/move nodes; connect/disconnect; group/ungroup; clone; validation.\n  - Simulation engine: deterministic, iterative with max iterations.\n  - Import/export + schema validation.\n  - Command APIs return new circuit state and Result objects; no side effects.\n- App layer:\n  - Zustand store orchestrates commands, manages selection, viewport, pending wire.\n  - React Flow adapter maps core graph ↔ React Flow nodes/edges; enforces invariants on connect.\n- UI layer:\n  - React components + React Flow renderers; design-system primitives.\n  - Consumes derived view models; never mutates core directly.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Canvas & Viewport**: Infinite pan/zoom (auto-expands as content approaches edge); background grid; optional snap-to-grid (off by default). Zoom: default 100%, min 2%, max 400%; smooth wheel/trackpad zoom; pointer-based panning; inertial pan optional. Grid: base 20px at 100% (faint), heavier lines every 80px; at 2% major boxes ~5120px. Movement increment scales with zoom (e.g., 5px at 400%).\n- **Palette/Toolbar**: Add switch, gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR), light; group/ungroup; clone; import/export; zoom reset. Keyboard-focusable.\n- **Placement & Dragging**: Drag from palette; drag existing nodes; wires update with movement. Disable node drag during multi-touch.\n- **Selection**: Click selects; Ctrl/Cmd+click toggles multi-select; selected nodes highlighted. Escape clears selection and pending wire.\n- **Wire Creation**: Output→input; pending edge preview; click wire to delete. Edge style toggle: bezier default, straight option (per-canvas).\n- **Wire Constraints**: Output→input only; one wire per input; outputs fan-out; no self-loop; reject invalid attempts with feedback.\n- **Simulation**: Run after any mutation (toggle, add/remove/move, connect/disconnect, group/ungroup/clone, import). Iterative, max 100 iterations. Switches seed map; gates evaluate; groups map through children; lights default false if disconnected.\n- **Grouping**:\n  - Create from selection: compute bounds; detect boundary wires; create group I/O ports; remap external wires; store child IDs.\n  - Collapse/expand (double-click): collapsed hides children, shows label/ports; expanded shows children.\n  - Ungroup: dissolve, restoring wiring to child ports.\n  - Clone: duplicate node/group at offset; new IDs/ports; duplicate internal wires; external wires not copied except via group internals.\n- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Delete/Backspace removes selected nodes; Escape clears selection and pending wire.\n- **Touch**: PointerEvents; single-finger drag nodes; two-finger pan; pinch-to-zoom; targets ≥44x44; disable node drag during multi-touch.\n- **Import/Export**: JSON v1.0 `{ version: \"1.0\", circuit: { nodes, wires } }`; validate; on success replace state and recompute signals; on failure leave state unchanged with clear error. Support v1.1 metadata `{ name, createdAt }`.\n\n## Intelligent Canvas & Design System\n- Canvas: custom RF background grid, configurable zoom bounds, smooth interactions. Context menus for canvas/nodes/wires (delete, clone, group/ungroup, rename group).\n- Port affordances: clear hit areas; hover/focus states; signal colors (on/off/unknown); pending-wire preview.\n- Wires: custom edge renderer with signal coloring; hover actions; selection; bezier default, straight toggle for debug.\n- Plugins/extensibility: hook points for custom node types, commands, context menu items, and import/export metadata.\n- Design tokens: spacing, radii, colors with contrast targets, typography, z-layers (canvas, wires, nodes, overlays, menus). Store in `src/design/tokens.ts`.\n- Components: button, icon button, segmented control, toolbar, panel, modal, toast, context menu, dropdown. Keyboard accessible.\n\n## Data Model (React-Oriented)\n- **GateType**: `'AND' | 'OR' | 'NOT' | 'NAND' | 'NOR' | 'XOR' | 'XNOR'`.\n- **Port**: `{ id: string; nodeId: string; kind: 'input' | 'output'; index: number; position?: { x: number; y: number } }`.\n- **Node (React Flow)**: `{ id, type, position: { x, y }, width, height, data }`.\n  - Switch: `type: 'switch'`, `data: { state: boolean; outputPortId: string }`.\n  - Gate: `type: 'gate'`, `data: { gateType: GateType; inputPortIds: string[]; outputPortId: string }`.\n  - Light: `type: 'light'`, `data: { state: boolean; inputPortId: string }`.\n  - Group: `type: 'group'`, `data: { label: string; childNodeIds: string[]; inputPortIds: string[]; outputPortIds: string[]; collapsed: boolean }`. Children hidden when collapsed.\n- **Edge/Wire**: `{ id: string; source: string; target: string; sourceNode: string; targetNode: string }` where source/target are port IDs; include styling metadata.\n- **UI State**: selection: `string[]`; pendingWire: `{ fromPortId?: string }`; viewport: `{ pan: { x, y }, zoom: number }`; activePointers for touch gestures.\n\n## Commands (Core API Sketch)\n- `addNode(node)`, `removeNode(nodeId)`, `moveNode(nodeId, delta)`.\n- `connect(fromPortId, toPortId)` with validation; returns Result.\n- `disconnect(wireId)`.\n- `createGroup(label, nodeIds)`, `ungroup(groupId)`, `toggleGroup(groupId)`, `cloneNode(nodeId, offset)`.\n- `importCircuit(json) -> Result<Circuit, Error[]>`; `exportCircuit(circuit) -> string`.\n- `simulate(circuit) -> SimulationResult` (map of port outputs, light states).\n- Commands are pure and return new circuit state plus structured errors.\n\n## Port Positioning\n- Switch: output on right edge, vertically centered.\n- Light: input on left edge, vertically centered.\n- Gate: inputs along left edge, spaced by `height / (n + 1) * (index + 1)`; output on right center.\n- Group: collapsed inputs on left, outputs on right, evenly spaced; expanded aligns ports to group bounding box edges.\n\n## Wire Validation Rules\n1. Direction: output → input only.\n2. Uniqueness: one wire per input.\n3. Fan-out: outputs may connect to multiple inputs.\n4. No self-loop: source nodeId !== target nodeId.\n5. Reject invalid connections without mutating state.\n\n## Signal Evaluation\n- `nodeOutputs = Map<portId, boolean>`.\n- Seed switches: `nodeOutputs[outputPortId] = switch.state`.\n- Iterate (≤100):\n  - Gates: gather input values (missing defaults false); evaluate:\n    - AND: all true\n    - OR: any true\n    - NOT: !a\n    - NAND: !(AND)\n    - NOR: !(OR)\n    - XOR: (sum(inputs) % 2) === 1\n    - XNOR: !XOR\n  - Groups: map group inputs into child graph, evaluate children, emit group outputs.\n  - Track changes; stop when stable or limit hit.\n- Lights: set from connected input wire, else false.\n- Trigger after any graph mutation or switch toggle.\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Rendering stack: React Flow edges are SVG; nodes are HTML/React components (can embed small SVG icons). Ports drawn as signal-colored handles/circles. No canvas requirement; vector edges keep crisp scaling.\n- Wires reflect signal state; pending wire previews cursor line.\n- Selection outline; hover highlights ports; invalid attempts give feedback.\n- Group labels visible; collapsed shows ports/counts; double-click toggles collapse.\n- Accessibility: focusable controls; adequate contrast; keyboard toggles for switches; context menus keyboard-operable.\n\n## Menu & Command System\n- Command registry: central typed registry for actions (add node, connect, delete, group, import/export, toggle snap, toggle edge style, zoom controls). UI invokes commands; commands delegate to core/app store mutations.\n- Menu registry: data-driven menus for toolbar, canvas/global, and context menus. Renderers consume registry; contributions can register items with predicates (e.g., based on selection or node type).\n- Extensibility: future plugins can add commands and menu items via registry hooks (app layer), without modifying core logic.\n\n## Import/Export Specification\n- **v1.0 shape**:\n  - `nodes`: id/type/position/width/height + type data (ports, gateType, state, label, childNodeIds, collapsed).\n  - `wires`: `{ id, fromPortId, toPortId }` (map to `source/target`).\n- **Validation**: referenced ports exist; direction correct; no duplicate input wires; supported gate types; supported version.\n- **Behavior**: on success set state, recompute ports, run simulation; on failure keep prior state and show error.\n- **Export**: `version: \"1.0\"`; allow optional metadata `{ name, createdAt }` (v1.1).\n\n## Touch & Pointer Handling\n- PointerEvents.\n- Single pointer: drag nodes.\n- Two pointers: pan; pinch-to-zoom.\n- Disable node drag during multi-touch; track active pointers.\n- Targets ≥44x44.\n\n## Keyboard & Mouse Interactions\n- Delete/Backspace: remove selected nodes (and attached wires).\n- Escape: clear selection and cancel pending wire.\n- Click wire: deletes wire.\n- Double-click group: collapse/expand.\n\n## Testing Strategy\n- Unit (Vitest): graph ops, validation, simulation truth tables, import/export round-trips, group/ungroup/clone rewiring.\n- Component (RTL): node renderers, port states, pending wire preview, context menus.\n- Integration (Playwright/Cypress): canvas interactions, grouping flows, import/export fixtures (half-adder), shortcuts, basic touch gestures (if supported).\n- Golden fixtures: sample circuits for import/export and simulation outputs.\n- Performance checks: propagation on dense graphs within target; responsive pan/zoom.\n\n## Testing Checklist (Manual)\n- Add switch/gate/light/group; drag to move; selection highlight works.\n- Wire constraints enforced; invalid connects blocked; wire deletion works.\n- Toggle switch updates gates/lights; gate truth tables hold; cycles stabilize within cap.\n- Group: create from selection; external wires remapped; collapse/expand; ungroup restores wiring; clone duplicates internals with new IDs.\n- Clone non-group node offsets position with new ports.\n- Import valid file loads; invalid rejected with clear error; half-adder works.\n- Touch: single drag moves node; two-finger pan; pinch zoom.\n- Keyboard: Delete/Backspace removes selection; Escape clears selection/pending wire.\n- Performance: large graphs stay responsive for pan/zoom/propagation.\n\n## React Implementation Notes\n- Use custom RF nodes for switch/gate/light/group; ports via `Handle` keyed by port IDs.\n- `onConnect` enforces wire rules before adding edge; app store is source of truth; RF consumes derived graph.\n- Simulation state in store, not components; rerun on graph mutations.\n- Groups: do not render children when collapsed; expanded renders children and internal edges; external edges stay on group handles.\n\n## Open Decisions (to lock pre-implementation)\n- All above decisions locked: Zustand; bezier default with straight option; snap-to-grid optional with specified grid sizes; zoom bounds and infinite pan; menu/command registries for extensibility. No pending decisions.\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\nTask: \"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\"\nTask: \"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2.

Commands\n+remain pure functions that accept state and return new state + results without leaking React\n+or UI concerns. New capabilities should deepen existing modules instead of widening surface\n+area. Rationale: shallow APIs erode flexibility; deep modules keep behavior predictable and\n+adaptable.\n+\n+### Separation of Concerns & Adapter Boundaries\n+Core logic MUST be independent of rendering and transport. The React Flow layer is an\n+adapter and never the source of truth; it consumes derived state from the app store and\n+returns intent through commands. Store/orchestration (e.g., Zustand) mediates between core\n+and UI; no React Flow types or UI state may bleed into `src/core`. Rationale: clean\n+boundaries protect the simulation from UI churn and enable alternative frontends.\n+\n+### Specification-Driven Development\n+Every module and feature MUST have written contracts (inputs/outputs/invariants/errors)\n+before coding. Specs cover core API, simulation rules, import/export schemas, and UI\n+interactions (gestures, shortcuts, accessibility). Any behavior change updates the relevant\n+spec before implementation and is referenced in PRs. Rationale: specifications prevent\n+ambiguous behavior and speed reviews.\n+\n+### TDD-First Coverage\n+Tests are written first and must fail before implementation. Core logic is fully unit-tested\n+with deterministic fixtures (Vitest); UI changes include component tests (React Testing\n+Library) and e2e coverage for interaction flows when behavior changes. No feature merges\n+without green tests and explicit red-green-refactor evidence. Rationale: guards regression\n+risk and keeps the simulation trustworthy.\n+\n+### Explicit Invariants & Validation\n+Graph validity (direction output→input, one wire per input, no self-loops), simulation\n+convergence bounds (≤100 iterations), and import/export schemas (v1.0 with v1.1 metadata)\n+MUST be encoded as invariants. Invalid operations reject without mutating state. Specs\n+record the invariants, and code asserts them at boundaries. Rationale: makes failure modes\n+obvious and debuggable.\n+\n+### Extensibility & Plugin Surfaces\n+Plugin-friendly surfaces for nodes, commands, menus, and metadata MUST remain stable.\n+Extensions register through defined registries instead of hardcoded conditionals. Changes\n+that constrain extension points require a migration note and version bump. Rationale:\n+preserves the ability to add new node types and commands without rewriting the core.\n+\n+## Architecture & Technology Constraints\n+\n+- Language/tooling: TypeScript + React + Vite; React Flow for rendering only; Zustand (or\n+  equivalent store) as app orchestrator.\n+- Directory ownership: `src/core` pure and framework-free; `src/app` bridges store and\n+  adapters; `src/ui` for React components and React Flow renderers; `src/design` for\n+  styling tokens and global themes; tests in `src/tests`.\n+- Core APIs expose pure commands and deterministic simulation; UI layers derive state from\n+  store queries and never mutate core data directly.\n+- Import/export must honor schema compatibility (v1.0 + forward-compatible v1.1 metadata);\n+  new metadata requires validation and migration notes.\n+\n+## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n+\n+- No implementation starts without updated specs capturing contracts, invariants, and\n+  UX behaviors for the change.\n+- Plans and tasks MUST include tests as first-class items (unit for core, component/e2e for\n+  UI) and map to specs; tests written and run before code lands.\n+- Code reviews verify principle adherence: core purity, adapter boundaries, invariants\n+  enforced, extension points preserved, and specs updated.\n+- Golden fixtures and validation suites back import/export, graph validity, and simulation\n+  truth tables; regressions require new fixtures or assertions.\n+- Documentation and design tokens update alongside behavior changes to keep the UI and\n+  core in sync.\n+\n+## Governance\n+\n+- This constitution supersedes other practice docs for architecture, testing, and workflow\n+  expectations.\n+- Amendments require: (1) a proposal referencing affected specs/contracts, (2) updated\n+  constitution version per semver (MAJOR for breaking/removal, MINOR for new/expanded\n+  principles, PATCH for clarifications), and (3) migration notes when extension points or\n+  schemas shift.\n+- Compliance is reviewed on every PR; violations block merge until corrected or explicitly\n+  justified with documented follow-up tasks and version bumps.\n+- Runtime guidance (e.g., `REACT_FLOW_REBUILD_SPEC.md`) must be kept aligned with the\n+  principles and cited in relevant plans/specs.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-12-09 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-09\n*** End Patch"}}
